# HLS Monitor üì∫üîçüìä

Service to monitor one or more HLS streams for manifest errors and inconsistencies.
These are:

- Media sequence counter issues.
- Discontinuity sequence counter issues.
- Detect stale manifests. The default is at least 6000ms but can be configured via the env `HLS_MONITOR_INTERVAL` or set when creating a new HLSMonitor.
The playlist is updating correctly.

## Command Line Executable

To run HLS monitor first install the executable:

```
npm install -g @eyevinn/hls-monitor
```

Then run:

```
hls-monitor URL-TO-MONITOR
```

## Setup

To initialize a new `HLSMonitorService` do the following:

```typescript
import { HLSMonitorService } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitorService
const hlsMonitorService = new HLSMonitorService();
// register the routes 
hlsMonitorService.listen(3000);
```

The monitor service is now up and running and available on port `3000`.
A basic Swagger doc can be accessed via `hls-monitor-endpoint/docs`

Start monitoring a new stream by doing a `POST` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

It's also possible to set the interval (in milliseconds) for when a manifest should be considered as stale, this is done via:

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"],
  "stale_limit": 6000
}
```

To get the latest error for a specific monitor do a `GET` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor/:monitorId/status`.

To remove a specific stream from a monitor do a `DELETE` to
`hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor/:monitorId` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "streams": ["streams-to-delete/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

Available endpoints are:

| Endpoint                         | Method   | Description                                                 |

| `/monitor/:monitorId/streams`    | `DELETE` | Remove streams from the monitor                             |
| `/metrics`                       | `GET`    | Get OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible metrics               |
| `/docs`                          | `GET`    | Swagger documentation UI                                    |
A few environment variables can be set to configure the service:

```text
HLS_MONITOR_INTERVAL=6000 # Interval in milliseconds for when a manifest should be considered stale
ERROR_LIMIT=10 # number of errors to be saved in memory
```

The `HLSMonitorService` can also be controlled through code by using the core `HLSMonitor` directly:

```typescript
import { HLSMonitor } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// Define a list of streams
const streams = ["stream-to-monitor-01/manifest.m3u8", "stream-to-monitor-02/manifest.m3u8"];

// Define stale limit in milliseconds (Defaults at 6000)
const staleLimit = 10000;

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitor
const monitor = new HLSMonitor(streams, staleLimit);

// Start the HLS-Monitor, it will begin polling and analyzing new manifests. 
monitor.start();

// ... after some time, check for the latest errors
const errors = await monitor.getErrors();
console.log(errors);
```

## Error Structure

When calling `getErrors()`, the monitor returns an array of error objects in reverse chronological order (newest first). Each error object has the following structure:

```typescript
type MonitorError = {
  eid: string;          // Unique error ID
  date: string;         // ISO timestamp of when the error occurred
  errorType: ErrorType; // Type of error (e.g., "Manifest Retrieval", "Media Sequence", etc.)
  mediaType: string;    // Type of media ("MASTER", "VIDEO", "AUDIO", etc.)
  variant: string;      // Variant identifier (bandwidth or group-id)
  details: string;      // Detailed error message
  streamUrl: string;    // URL of the stream where the error occurred
  streamId: string;     // ID of the stream
  code?: number;        // HTTP status code (for manifest retrieval errors)
}

enum ErrorType {
  MANIFEST_RETRIEVAL = "Manifest Retrieval",
  MEDIA_SEQUENCE = "Media Sequence",
  PLAYLIST_SIZE = "Playlist Size",
  PLAYLIST_CONTENT = "Playlist Content",
  SEGMENT_CONTINUITY = "Segment Continuity",
  DISCONTINUITY_SEQUENCE = "Discontinuity Sequence",
  STALE_MANIFEST = "Stale Manifest"
}
```

Example error object:
```json
{
  "eid": "eid-1234567890",
  "date": "2024-01-30T12:34:56.789Z",
  "errorType": "Manifest Retrieval",
  "mediaType": "VIDEO",
  "variant": "1200000",
  "details": "Failed to fetch variant manifest (404)",
  "streamUrl": "https://example.com/stream.m3u8",
  "streamId": "stream_1",
  "code": 404
}
```

## Metrics

The service exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that provides OpenMetrics/Prometheus-compatible metrics. These metrics can be used to monitor the health and status of your HLS streams in real-time.

### Available Metrics

```text
# HELP hls_monitor_info Information about the HLS monitor
# TYPE hls_monitor_info gauge
hls_monitor_info{monitor_id="...", state="active"} 1

# HELP hls_monitor_manifest_fetch_errors Current manifest fetch errors with details
# TYPE hls_monitor_manifest_fetch_errors gauge
hls_monitor_manifest_fetch_errors{monitor_id="...",url="...",status_code="404",media_type="VIDEO",variant="1200000",stream_id="..."} 1

# HELP hls_monitor_stream_total_errors Total number of errors detected per stream since monitor creation
# TYPE hls_monitor_stream_total_errors counter
hls_monitor_stream_total_errors{monitor_id="...",stream_id="..."} 42

# HELP hls_monitor_stream_time_since_last_error_seconds Time since the last error was detected for each stream
# TYPE hls_monitor_stream_time_since_last_error_seconds gauge
hls_monitor_stream_time_since_last_error_seconds{monitor_id="...",stream_id="..."} 1234.56

# HELP hls_monitor_new_errors_total Count of new errors detected since last check
# TYPE hls_monitor_new_errors_total counter
hls_monitor_new_errors_total{monitor_id="...",error_type="Manifest Retrieval",media_type="VIDEO",stream_id="..."} 1
```

### Using with Prometheus and Grafana

These metrics can be scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. We provide example configurations and a demo dashboard in the `examples/local-grafana-dashboards` directory.

To get started with monitoring:

1. Configure Prometheus to scrape the `/metrics` endpoint
2. Import our demo Grafana dashboard
3. Start monitoring your streams with real-time visualizations

See our [local Grafana setup guide](examples/local-grafana-dashboards/how-to-setup-local-grafana.md) for detailed instructions.
