# hls-monitor

Service to monitor one or more hls streams for manifest errors and inconsistencies.
Possible inconsistencies and errors are:
  - Media sequence counter issues. 
  - Discontinuity sequence counter issues. 
  - Detect stale manifests. The default is at least 6000ms but can be configured via the env `HLS_MONITOR_INTERVAL` or set when creating a new HLSMonitor. 
  - Playlist is updating correctly. 

## Setup

To initialize a new `HLSMonitorService` do: 

```typescript
import { HLSMonitorService } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitorService
const hlsMonitorService = new HLSMonitorService();
// register the routes 
hlsMonitorService.listen(3000);
```
The monitor service is now up and running and available on port `3000`.
A basic Swagger doc can be accessed via `hls-monitor-endpoint/docs`

Start monitoring a new stream by doing a `PUT` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/create` with the following payload: 

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

It's also possible to set the interval (in milliseconds) for when a manifest should be considered as stale, this is done via: 

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"],
  "stale_limit": 6000
}
```

To get the latest error do a `GET` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/status`. 

To stop monitoring a specific stream do a `PUT` to 
`hls-monitor-endpoint/delete` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "streams": ["streams-to-delete/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

Available endpoints are: 

`POST` /monitor

`GET` /monitor

`PUT` /monitor/:monitorId/delete

`GET` /monitor/:monitorId/status

`DELETE` /monitor/:monitorId/status

`GET` /monitor/:monitorId/streams

`GET` /healthcheck

`POST` /monitor/:monitorId/start

`POST` /monitor/:monitorId/stop

The `HLSMonitorService` can also be controlled through code:

```typescript
import { HLSMonitorService } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitorService
const hlsMonitorService = new HLSMonitorService();

// create a new hls-monitor
const streams = ["streams-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"];
hlsMonitorService.monitor.create(streams);

// Get latest errors
const errors = hlsMonitorService.monitor.getErrors();
console.log(errors);
```
