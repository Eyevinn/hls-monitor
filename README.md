# HLS Monitor

Service to monitor one or more HLS streams for manifest errors and inconsistencies.
These are:

- Media sequence counter issues.
- Discontinuity sequence counter issues.
- Detect stale manifests. The default is at least 6000ms but can be configured via the env `HLS_MONITOR_INTERVAL` or set when creating a new HLSMonitor.
The playlist is updating correctly.

## Command Line Executable

To run HLS monitor first install the executable:

```
npm install -g @eyevinn/hls-monitor
```

Then run:

```
hls-monitor URL-TO-MONITOR
```

## Setup

To initialize a new `HLSMonitorService` do the following:

```typescript
import { HLSMonitorService } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitorService
const hlsMonitorService = new HLSMonitorService();
// register the routes 
hlsMonitorService.listen(3000);
```

The monitor service is now up and running and available on port `3000`.
A basic Swagger doc can be accessed via `hls-monitor-endpoint/docs`

Start monitoring a new stream by doing a `POST` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

It's also possible to set the interval (in milliseconds) for when a manifest should be considered as stale, this is done via:

```json
{
  "streams": ["stream-to-monitor/manifest.m3u8"],
  "stale_limit": 6000
}
```

To get the latest error for a specific monitor do a `GET` to `hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor/:monitorId/status`.

To remove a specific stream from a monitor do a `DELETE` to
`hls-monitor-endpoint/monitor/:monitorId` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "streams": ["streams-to-delete/manifest.m3u8"]
}
```

Available endpoints are:

| Endpoint                         | Method   | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                              | `GET`    | Heartbeat endpoint of service                               |
| `/monitor`                       | `POST`   | Start monitoring a new stream                               |
| `/monitor`                       | `GET`    | List all monitors                                           |
| `/monitor`                       | `DELETE` | Delete all monitored streams                                |
| `/monitor/:monitorId`            | `DELETE` | Delete a specific stream                                    |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/start`      | `POST`   | Start a specific monitor                                    |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/stop`       | `POST`   | Stop a specific monitor                                     |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/status`     | `GET`    | Get the current status of a stream                          |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/status`     | `DELETE` | Delete the cached status of a stream                        |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/streams`    | `GET`    | Returns a list of all streams that are currently monitored  |
| `/monitor/:monitorId/streams`    | `PUT`    | Add a stream to the list of streams that will be monitored  |

A few environment variables can be set to configure the service:

```text
HLS_MONITOR_INTERVAL=6000 # Interval in milliseconds for when a manifest should be considered stale
ERROR_LIMIT=10 # number of errors to be saved in memory
```

The `HLSMonitorService` can also be controlled through code by using the core `HLSMonitor` directly:

```typescript
import { HLSMonitor } from "@eyevinn/hls-monitor";

// Define a list of streams
const streams = ["stream-to-monitor-01/manifest.m3u8", "stream-to-monitor-02/manifest.m3u8"];

// Define stale limit in milliseconds (Defaults at 6000)
const staleLimit = 10000;

// initialize a new instance of HLSMonitor
const monitor = new HLSMonitor(streams, staleLimit);

// Start the HLS-Monitor, it will begin polling and analyzing new manifests. 
monitor.start();

// ... after some time, check for the latest errors
const errors = await monitor.getErrors();
console.log(errors);
```
